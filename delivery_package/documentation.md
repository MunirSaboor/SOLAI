# iOS Application Documentation

## Overview

This iOS application was developed using React Native with Expo, allowing for cross-platform development while maintaining native iOS look and feel. The application features a modern UI with support for both light and dark modes, responsive design for various iPhone screen sizes, and intuitive navigation.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Expo Router file-based routing structure:

- `/app/` - Contains the main application screens and navigation
  - `/(tabs)/` - Tab-based navigation screens
    - `index.tsx` - Home screen
    - `explore.tsx` - Explore screen
    - `settings.tsx` - Settings screen
  - `_layout.tsx` - Root layout configuration
  - `test-components.tsx` - Component testing screen
  - `test-features.tsx` - Feature testing screen
  - `test-responsiveness.tsx` - Responsiveness testing screen

- `/components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `/ui/` - Basic UI components (Button, FormInput, etc.)
  - `UserProfile.tsx` - User profile management component
  - `ContentLibrary.tsx` - Content library component
  - `Notifications.tsx` - Notifications settings component
  - `ThemedText.tsx` - Text component with theming support
  - `ThemedView.tsx` - View component with theming support

- `/constants/` - Application constants
  - `Colors.ts` - Base color definitions
  - `EnhancedColors.ts` - Extended iOS-style color palette
  - `Typography.ts` - Text styles following iOS guidelines

## Features

### Home Screen
The home screen provides an introduction to the application with information about its features and capabilities.

### Explore Screen
The explore screen showcases the app's features with collapsible sections and external links to resources.

### Settings Screen
The settings screen contains three main sections:

1. **User Profile**
   - Form for entering and saving user information
   - Input validation for required fields
   - Profile data management

2. **Content Library**
   - Filterable list of content items
   - Category-based filtering
   - Favorites functionality
   - Detail view for content items

3. **Notifications**
   - Toggle settings for different notification types
   - Delivery method preferences
   - Alert settings (sound, vibration)

## Design System

The application implements a comprehensive design system following iOS guidelines:

### Colors
- iOS-standard color palette for both light and dark modes
- Semantic color naming (primary, secondary, success, etc.)
- Automatic adaptation to system light/dark mode

### Typography
- iOS-standard text styles (largeTitle, title1, body, etc.)
- Consistent font sizing and weights
- Proper letter spacing and line heights

### Components
- **ThemedText**: Text component with support for all typography styles
- **ThemedView**: View component with variants (default, card, grouped)
- **Button**: iOS-style button with variants and sizes
- **FormInput**: Form input with label, error, and helper text support

## Development Environment

This application was developed using:
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript for type safety
- Expo Router for navigation
- Node.js and npm for package management

## Testing

The application includes dedicated test screens for verifying functionality:

- **Component Testing**: Verifies all UI components
- **Feature Testing**: Tests core functionality components
- **Responsiveness Testing**: Checks dark mode and responsive layouts

## Deployment

For deployment to iOS devices, the application can be built using:
- Expo EAS Build service for cloud-based iOS builds
- TestFlight for beta distribution
- App Store for production release

## Limitations

Since this application was developed in a Linux environment, some iOS-specific features may require additional testing on actual iOS devices or simulators. The test screens provide a way to verify functionality without direct iOS simulator access.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for this application include:
- Backend integration for user authentication and data persistence
- Push notification implementation
- Offline support
- Additional iOS-specific features (haptic feedback, etc.)
