# Packaging Instructions for iOS Application

## Overview

This document provides instructions for packaging and deploying the iOS application built with React Native and Expo. Since the application was developed in a Linux environment without direct access to iOS build tools, we'll use Expo's cloud build services for iOS deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before packaging the application, ensure you have:

1. An Expo account (create one at https://expo.dev/signup)
2. An Apple Developer account (required for App Store distribution)
3. The Expo CLI installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
4. The EAS CLI installed globally (`npm install -g eas-cli`)

## Packaging Steps

### 1. Configure app.json

The `app.json` file contains important configuration for your application. Ensure the following fields are properly set:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "My iOS App",
    "slug": "my-ios-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon.png",
    "userInterfaceStyle": "automatic",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/images/splash-icon.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.myiosapp"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Configure EAS Build

Create an `eas.json` file in the project root with the following content:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 0.60.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {}
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

### 3. Login to Expo

```bash
expo login
```

### 4. Configure the Project for EAS Build

```bash
eas build:configure
```

### 5. Build for iOS

#### Development Build (for testing)

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

#### Preview Build (for internal distribution)

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

#### Production Build (for App Store)

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### 6. Submit to App Store

Once you have a production build, you can submit it to the App Store:

```bash
eas submit --platform ios
```

## Alternative: Expo Application Services (EAS)

For a more streamlined experience, you can use Expo's managed services:

1. **EAS Build**: Cloud service to build native apps
2. **EAS Submit**: Automate App Store submissions
3. **EAS Update**: Push updates to your app without rebuilding

To use these services:

```bash
# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Create a build profile
eas build --platform ios

# Submit to App Store
eas submit --platform ios
```

## Local Testing Options

While developing on Linux, you can test your application using:

1. **Expo Go app**: Install on an iOS device and scan the QR code from `expo start`
2. **Web browser**: Use `expo start --web` for basic functionality testing
3. **Expo Snack**: Create a Snack at https://snack.expo.dev/ to test specific components

## Delivery Package Contents

The final delivery package for this iOS application includes:

1. **Source Code**: Complete React Native/Expo project
2. **Documentation**:
   - Technical Documentation
   - User Guide
   - Developer Guide
   - This Packaging Guide
3. **Build Instructions**: Steps to build and deploy the application
4. **Test Screens**: Components for verifying functionality

## Next Steps

After packaging and delivering the application:

1. **User Acceptance Testing**: Have stakeholders test the application
2. **Feedback Collection**: Gather feedback for improvements
3. **Maintenance Plan**: Establish a plan for updates and maintenance
4. **Analytics Integration**: Consider adding analytics to track usage
